# Stars-Wars-Game
Created a backend program game using C++ where the user is manning a spaceship seeking a new life while avoiding plasma storms!
The user can use randomly generated coordinates for shapes depicting planets and plasma storms or input their own using different shapes (cross, circles, stars, etc)
The user has to find the best path to the “Exit” in the virtual grid (space); selecting planets brings them closer to the “Exit” while plasma storms bring them away from the “Exit”
